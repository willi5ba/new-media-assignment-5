            My name is Brianna Williams.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am a forth year student at University of Cincinnati. For my final Capstone next semester, I am showcasing my improvements with the media aspects of my brand.

            To go a little more in depth, the clothing brand, Sincerely KHAOS, donates
            <i>10% of their profit to American Cancer Society</i>. The main color of the brand is lavender (hence why the background color is lavender).
            I am currently starting the brand to help establish a comfortable point where I can focus on the media sides and not as much of the entreprenurship side.
